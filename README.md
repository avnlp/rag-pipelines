## Developing

### Installing dependencies

The development environment can be set up using
[uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv?tab=readme-ov-file#installation). Hence, make sure it is
installed and then run:

```bash
uv sync
source .venv/bin/activate
```

In order to install dependencies for testing (codestyle, unit tests, integration tests),
run:

```bash
uv sync --dev
source .venv/bin/activate
```

In order to exclude installation of packages from a specific group (e.g. docs),
run:

```bash
uv sync --no-group docs
```
